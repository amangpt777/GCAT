	<h1>Growth Curve Analysis Tool</h1>

	<div style="width:45%;">
	  This tool processes microbial growth curve data collected in a microtiter plate format and 
	  generates a table of biologically meaningful growth curve characteristics, as well as relevant 
	  plots. These characteristics can be used to select strains with optimal growth properties.
